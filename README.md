# BullshitCompass
The Bullshit Compass project aims to create software that identifies vague, fluffy, syntactically correct but meaningless language ("bullshit") in business texts like memos and pitch decks. Distinct from detecting lies, it focuses on linguistic fog. Development started spec-first (RFC FS02) due to the concept's complexity.
