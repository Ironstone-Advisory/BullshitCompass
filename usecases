Investment Due Diligence & Financial Analysis: Scan prospectuses, white papers, annual reports, and pitch decks to flag excessive jargon (BLI), vague promises (AAR), emotional hype (EPF), or potentially misleading framing of data (DPO). This could help analysts and investors look past persuasive rhetoric to better assess underlying substance.

Advertising Copy Effectiveness: Analyze ad copy, social media posts, and landing pages to measure the ratio of substantive claims versus buzzwords (BLI), emotional appeals (EPF), ambiguity (AAR), and empty statements (TCR).
