Investment Due Diligence & Financial Analysis: Scan prospectuses, white papers, annual reports, and pitch decks to flag excessive jargon (BLI), vague promises (AAR), emotional hype (EPF), or potentially misleading framing of data (DPO). This could help analysts and investors look past persuasive rhetoric to better assess underlying substance.

Academic & Research Integrity: Analyze research papers, grant proposals, or reports for signs of inflated claims, misused terminology (PRM), significant semantic drift (SDS), or other rhetorical patterns that might obscure weak methodology or lack of novelty. It could serve as an initial screening tool for editors or reviewers.

Internal Communications & Strategy Review: Evaluate internal memos, strategic plans, corporate presentations, or project proposals for clarity and realism. It could help identify internal echo chambers, overly optimistic language unsupported by specifics (AAR, TCR), or communication designed more for bureaucratic performance than clear direction (potentially linking to the Graeber context).

AI-Generated Content Quality Control: Assess text produced by Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI systems. While AI can generate fluent text, the Compass could help flag instances where the output is coherent but potentially vacuous, overly reliant on clich√©s (OOI), or exhibiting other forms of sophisticated bullshit that lack genuine meaning or grounding.

Journalism & Fact-Checking Augmentation: Assist journalists or fact-checkers in analyzing political speeches, press releases, or opinion pieces. Beyond checking factual accuracy, the Compass could highlight rhetorical strategies being used, such as ambiguity (AAR), emotional manipulation (EPF), Orwellian obfuscation (OOI), or attempts to smuggle claims (ISI), providing deeper context on how a message is constructed.
