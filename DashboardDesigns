# Bullshit Compass – Interface and Visualization Mockup

## Overview
This document describes a conceptual mockup for a **multi-layered user interface** for the Bullshit Compass, combining textual analysis, interactive sliders, and a global visual dashboard styled after the **Johns Hopkins COVID-19 map**, reimagined as a **"Bullshit GlobeScope."**

---

## Level 1 – High-Level Summary View

### Components:
- **Document Upload or URL Input**
- **Composite Bullshit Score Meter** (0–100 scale, color coded)
- **Mini-Radar Chart** with 7 or 8 wedges (1 per sub-index)
- **Document Flag Summary** (number and type of rhetorical issues detected)
- **Quick Verdict** (e.g., "⚠️ High Manipulative Risk", "✅ Mostly Clean")

### User Controls:
- File input or live doc link
- Toggle for: "Run Basic Scan" vs. "Run Deep Semantic Scan"

---

## Level 2 – Interactive Analysis Panel

### Components:
- **Expandable Radar Chart** (click wedges for detail)
- **Sentence-Level Annotation Viewer**
  - Highlighted text colored by type (e.g., yellow = tautology, red = pseudoscience)
  - Popovers show score and rationale
- **Sub-score Sliders for Sensitivity Adjustment**
  - Adjust detection thresholds per signal (e.g., more strict buzzword detection)
  - Example slider labels:
    - TCR (Tautology Strictness)
    - PWI (Ideological Inference Sensitivity)
    - SDS (Drift Radius in Tokens or Sentences)

### User Actions:
- Click any radar axis → filters flagged sentences
- Download annotated document (PDF, .docx, JSON)
- Compare to baseline corpus (e.g., "Clean Report Benchmarks")

---

## Level 3 – Bullshit GlobeScope

### Dashboard Overview:
- Interactive World Map (D3.js / WebGL based)
- **Country-level bullshit detection heatmap**
  - Real-time data collected from flagged documents globally (using opt-in Finger Spider crawlers)
- Filterable by:
  - Document type (press releases, research, marketing, AI-generated)
  - Source (corporate, government, anonymous)
  - Date range

### GlobeScope Metrics:
- "Average National Bullshit Index"
- Top 10 Rhetorical Offenders (regions + document clusters)
- Trending Buzzwords and Pseudoscientific Terms
- Daily/weekly changes in composite scores

---

## Future Layer: OrgView + Context Replayer
- **Organizational view** for internal documents scored over time
- **Replay mode** for seeing how a document's bullshit footprint evolves through drafts
- Enable traceability for misinformation compliance, editorial coaching, or audit trails

---

## Visual Style References
- Color palette: Adaptive from red (high bullshit) to blue (neutral) to green (clean)
- UI inspiration: John Hopkins COVID Dashboard, Nightingale visual essays, NYT scrollytelling interfaces

---

## Purpose
This mockup enables both individual users and enterprise/institutional analysts to:
- Get fast bullshit assessments
- Dig into document semantics with transparency
- Observe large-scale bullshit patterns across domains and geographies

**Built on Finger Spider. Powered by the Compass. For a clearer narrative world.**
